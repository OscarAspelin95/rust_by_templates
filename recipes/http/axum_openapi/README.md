# Problem
You need to add API documentation for an axum http server.

# Solution
Use the utopia crate.

# Notes
In this example, we implement a `/user` route with mock `GET` and `POST` endpoints to illustrate how to document our API.


Run `cargo run` and visit `http://<...>` to check the API documentation.
