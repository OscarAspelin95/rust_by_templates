# Rust Cookbook
This repository serves the purpose of providing a collection of Rust recipes for beginner to intermediate developers.  

## Motivation
This is by no means a guideline for writing industry standard Rust code. Neither is the focus on writing the fastest, most optimized code. Rather, this project contains common patterns I frequently encounter when writing Rust code.

## How To Use
Each recipe has a README with instructions on usage.

## Requirements
Rust >= 1.90

## TODO
Add an mdbook.

## Disclaimer
This project is NOT vibe-coded.
